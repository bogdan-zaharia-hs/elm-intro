# Elm intro examples

## Usage

### Installing elm
```sh
$ npm i -g elm
```
That will install the following tools:
    - elm-repl
    - elm-make - for compiling elm files
    - elm-reactor - a dev server
    - elm-package - for managing packages

For more details, as well as editor/IDE integrations, see [the `install` section of the guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html). Also note [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format), which auto-formats your code according to the official styleguide.

### Running the examples
```sh
$ elm package install --yes
$ elm reactor
$ open http://localhost:8000
```
